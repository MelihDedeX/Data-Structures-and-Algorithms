# Binary Search Tree 
 [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] write the Binary-Search-Tree stages of the sequence.

 ## Binary Search Tree Stages
 ```
 [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] We start reading the sequence from the left.
 If the number we are reading is larger than the previous number, if it is small to the right of the number, we move to the left in the form of a root.
